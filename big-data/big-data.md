## N "V"s of Big Data

The key of big data is integrating diverse data from multiple sources.Data integrations reduces data complexity and increases data availability, and unifies your data system

* Data from People
  * highly unstructured
    * pictures, videos, HTML, XML, PPT, PDF
  * big \( 30 PB from Facebook, 100 PB from Google daily\)
* Data from Machines
  * Real-time data stream
  * high needs of bringing computation to data
  * environment monitoring, machine health, smart metering, activity tracking...
* Data from Organizations
  * usually structured 
    * transactions, credit card, e-commerce, government data ...
  * highly siloed
    * data can be unconnected information islands, outdated, unsynchronized, even invisible data
    * hinders opportunity generation

The Vs

![](/assets/4V.png)

* Volume
  * storage, access and processing challenges
* Variety
  * structural: formats and models
  * semantic: interpret and operate on data
  * media: medium in which data get delivered
  * Availability: real-time? Intermittent?
  * The key is scalability issues
* Velocity
  * real time processing: feed real time to machines, process real time
  * batch processing: collect, clean, feed in chunks, wait, act
* Veracity
  * data quality issue
  * accuracy of the data, reliability of data source, context within analysis
* Value 
* Valence: Connectedness of data
  * more complex data exploration algorithms
  * modeling and prediction of valence chnges
  * Group event detection
  * Emergent behavior analysis

### 5P's of Data Science

* People, Purpose
* Process
* Platfoms
* Programmability - finally automation

### Build a Big Data Team

* provide clear business objectives
* organizational sponsorship
* in house training
* big data policy and data sharing
  * privacy and lifetime
  * curation and quality
  * interoperability and regulation
  * analytics + business = opportunities 

### Data Science Steps

* Acquire Data
  * databases: SQL and query browsers
  * text files, scripting languages
  * web: HTML, JSON, RSS
    * SOAP, REST, WebSocket
  * NoSQL Storage
    * mongoDB, neo4j, cassandra, HBase, CouchDB
* Prepare Data
  * Exploring Data
    * data visualization
    * analytics, informatics building
  * Pre-processing
    * Data Clean + Data Transform
      * eg. inconsistent values, duplicate records, missing values, invalid data, outliers
      * removing, fill, merge\(duplicates\), winsorization
    * Data Wrangling/Data Munging/Data preprocessing
      * Dimensionality Reduction
      * Data Manipulation
      * Transformation
      * Feature Selection
      * Scaling
* Analyze Data
  * Build machine learning models
    * classification, regression, clustering, association analysis, graph analytics
    * model evaluation and selection
* Report Insights
  * visualization tools
    * Google developers charts, tableau, timeline, python, R...
* Insights to Actions
  * Access Impact, determine next steps
  * real time action and automations
