### UML to Describe Software Design

* UML Class Diagram
  * also used for the logical view of the sytem
* UML Sequence Diagram
  * describes the lifetimes of objects
* UML State Diagram
  * logical view

### UML to Describe Software Architecture

* UML Component Diagram
  * **Components **are independent, encapsulated units within a system
  * show high-level structure
  * ball connectors \(provided interface\) - socket connectors\(required interface\)
* UML Package Diagrams
  * **Package** groups together elements of software that are related. 
  * organize a complete system into packages of packageable elements. \(Data, classes, packages\)
  * access/import/merge, public and private
* UML Deployment Diagram
  * **artifacts**: physical results of the development process. \(eg. executable, installer, audio libaries\)
  * **Specification-Level Diagrams**
    * overview of artifacts and deployment targets. 
  * **Instance-Level Diagrams**
    * maps specific artifacts to specific deployment targets. \( specific machines and hardware devices\)
  * **Nodes**: deployment targets that contain artifacts available for execution
  * **Manifestation**: relationship where an artifact is a physical realization of a software component. It can be represented with a "**manifests**" indicator. 
* UML Activity Diagram
  * **Activities** are actions that further the flow of execution in a system
  * representation of the control flow from activity to another in a software system. 
  * captures the dynamic behavior of the system and allows the mapping of branching into alternative flows. 
  * must
    * identify the activities
    * identify the respective conditions of the system's activities
  * start, end, condition, swimlane
