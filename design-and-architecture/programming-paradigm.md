# Programming Paradigms

* **Imperative Paradigm**: Break up large programs into **subroutines. Global Data**\(locate in one place, accessible to one program\) is used to optimized performance
  * COBOL, Fortran
* **Procedure Programming:** introduce local variables \(subroutine and procedure's own variables\). Support abstract data type. \(defined by programmer, not built into the language\), this is a grouping of related information that is denoted with a type.organize information in a meaningful way.
  * Algol 68, Pascal
* **Modular Languages**: provided means to organize programs into separate files, allow developers to create multiple but unique copies of abstract data types.  \(eg. in , library, and header file\)
  * C,  Modula-2
* **Object-Oriented Programming**: allow inheritance of abstract data types. Structure programs around ABD called classes. \(methods + data\). 
  * C++, Java, Small Talk, C\#
* **Generic Programming:** recognize many algorithms and container types
  * C++ templates, Java generics
  * Python: python objects have type, variables not, everything is generic
* **Functional Programming**
  * Lisp, Scala
