# String

Linear List with char members

* Immutable \(Java, Python\) vs. mutable \(C++\)
  * [Immutable String](https://lemire.me/blog/2017/07/07/are-your-strings-immutable/)
  * Immutable string has the benefit to be safer in parallel environments
  * Operations usually on the whole string rather than a single member \(not same with usual linear list\)
* Storage method same to linear lists
  * special "end of string" \(\0\) \(like NULL, FALSE, 0\)
* char
  * ASCII, UNICODE, CJK...
* string literal \(constant\) and string variable \(C++\)
