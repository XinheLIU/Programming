# Data Structures

## Abstract Data Structures

**Abstract Data Type \(ADT\)** does not specify implementation

- ADT defines Operation P and operation object D
- Define Logic structure, then define computation/operation
  
## Common Data Structures to Use

Graph &gt;= Tree &gt;= Linear Structure

- Linear Structure
  - Direct Access: Vector, Record
  - Sequential Access: Linear Lists, Sequential Files
    - array, linked list, stack, queue ...
  - Directory Access: Dictionary, Hash Table
- Non-linear Structure
  - Tree \(Binary, Huffman, Binary Search...\)
