### What is Python?

* A scripting language \( source code -&gt;intepreter\) : source code --&gt; compiler --&gt; byte code -&gt; intepreter
  * python virtual machine
  * no need for def main\(\), but you can run by if \_\_\__name\_\_\_ = 'main":
* dynamic reference\( type can change at run time\), strongly-typed language
* almost everything in python is an **object\(id, name\),** bind with names
  * dir\(\)-display names in the current local scope
* """... """ can produce automatic model documents
* library
* * glue language
* functional programing
* object oriented
* multi-purpose
  * web: WSGI API, Django framework, Flask, cache, unit test, 
  * GUI: wxPython, PyQt
  * OS: linux, mac, NetBSD
  * game: 3D model
  * Data sicence: integrating with C, C++ and FORTRAN 
  * prototyping + production
* Weakness
  * single thread
    * global interpreter lock\(GIL\) determines interpreter can only execute one line at the same time
    * Python C extensions can use native multithreading \(in C or C++\) can run code parrallel without being impacted by GIL
